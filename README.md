I'm Pavan Kumar, a passionate and results-oriented Java Full Stack Developer with 2 years of hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and high-performance web applications. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and Microservices, with additional skills in frontend development using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Thymeleaf.

Over the past 2 years, I’ve been part of Agile teams working on enterprise-grade applications like Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools. My responsibilities have included designing backend architecture, developing REST APIs, integrating databases, implementing security protocols like JWT/OAuth2, and delivering responsive UI features.

I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and follow best practices in software engineering, including unit testing with JUnit, debugging with SLF4J/Log4j, and version control using Git. I am well-versed in Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and have worked extensively with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

My expertise also includes implementing microservices using Spring Cloud, Eureka, Feign Clients, API Gateway, and WebClient, enabling seamless inter-service communication and load-balanced infrastructure.

In addition to my technical skills, I’m a strong believer in collaboration, continuous learning, and delivering real business value through software. I’ve worked in Agile/Scrum environments where I actively participated in sprint planning, daily standups, code reviews, and production deployments.

I’ve also completed multiple certifications including:
• Java Full Stack Development – iNeuron
• Java & Web Technologies – Infosys Springboard
• Microsoft Copilot Certification

I regularly work on personal and open-source projects to sharpen my skills. Feel free to check out my GitHub for some of my work:
